AS A cook I want to ensure that I get the most out of all of my groceries
so I've created this website so that I can identify recipes that will include the ingredients
that I already have .

Additionally I search for recipes that offer variety
since food is one of my many expressions of love.

As a food lover I enjoy offering dishes from many different cultures so that I can
impress my friends and family.

Additionally, AS A person responsible for a houshold I look up ingredients of recipes
so that I can estimate costs of my next purchases for new recipes.
